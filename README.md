# UPDATE
Note that this has moved beyond proof of concept and is now [implemented here](https://github.com/CGCookie/blender-addon-updater), used in production by several addons.

# blender-addon-updater
Proof of concept for a blender 3d addon that automatically detects and installs other addon updates.

Still a work in progress and is yet currently functional.
Todo list at the moment inside the addon file itself

Project currently continuing in [development here](https://github.com/TeamDeverse/retopoflow), with this [issue link](https://github.com/CGCookie/retopoflow/issues/216)
